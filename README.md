# Heart-Disease-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
Prediction of occurrences of heart disease in the medical field is significant work. The storage data can be useful for the source of predicting the occurrence of feature disease.
In the project, we try to concentrate on heart disease prediction. Machine learning technique used to predict heart disease is Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Softwares Used:

Jupyter Notebook: To support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. 
Python: It is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
